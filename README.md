The project pulls together three datasets and seeks to provide an interactive visual display of the key datapoints.

The bubble chart is dynamically created based upon an [EV Dataset](assets/data/EVs.csv)- using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js.  The chart is responsive to screen size. Detailed data on a bubble is obtained by hovering over the bubble- the user verifies which bubble has been selected by its transition to lime green.  The decision was made to not statically label each bubble because of overlapping bubbles.: <a href="https://danawoodruff.github.io/d3-challenge/">View GitHub-Page</a><br>

Users can view the original data sources via live links at the bottom of the page.
