          <h2>EV Sales have room to grow...and so do charging networks.</h2><br>
          <p>Electric vehicles are becoming popular with Americans and with stock market investors.
            Despite being a common topic of conversation, EV adoption is still in its infancy with
            less than 1% of drivers slipping behind the wheel of one. Automakers are rushing to catch
            up to market leader Tesla. </p>

          <p>Charging networks are hot on the heels of automakers. As the EV market grows so must
            charging networks. Tesla has built their own Level 1 charging network but most manufacturers
            and retail locations depend on the slower Level 2 chargers. The chart demonstrates a rough
            average of 2-3 chargers per ten cars. With almost 600,000 EVs claiming their place in garages
            in 2020, and sales expected to increase by 70% in 2021, that is a potential market of over 20,000
            new charging stations each year. </p>

          <p>In 2011 there were approximately 10,000 new EV registrations in the country compared to over a
            half million last year...the math is clear on this one!</p>
